#Sign Language Classification



In the United States alone there are 11.500.000
people with some sort of hearing impairment. Sign Language
detection can improve the communication between deaf and the
general population. We are pleased to present the implementation of sign language recognition using three different models.
Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and KNearest Neighbors. Using these algorithms we achieved 99.89%,
84.18% and 81.38% accuracy respectively.
